abstract = {Within the special geometry of the simplex, the sample space of compositional data, compositional orthonormal coordinates allow the application of any multivariate statistical approach. The search for meaningful coordinates has suggested balances (between two groups of parts)—based on a sequential binary partition of a D-part composition—and a representation in form of a CoDa-dendrogram. Projected samples are represented in a dendrogram-like graph showing: (a) the way of grouping parts; (b) the explanatory role of subcompositions generated in the partition process; (c) the decomposition of the variance; (d) the center and quantiles of each balance. The representation is useful for the interpretation of balances and to describe the sample in a single diagram independently of the number of parts. Also, samples of two or more populations, as well as several samples from the same population, can be represented in the same graph, as long as they have the same parts registered. The approach is illustrated with an example of food consumption in Europe},

abstract = {In the life sciences, many measurement methods yield only the relative abundances of different components in a sample. With such relative-or compositional-data, differential expression needs careful interpretation, and correlation-a statistical workhorse for analyzing pairwise relationships-is an inappropriate measure of association. Using yeast gene expression data we show how correlation can be misleading and present proportionality as a valid alternative for relative data. We show how the strength of proportionality between two variables can be meaningfully and interpretably described by a new statistic ϕ which can be used instead of correlation as the basis of familiar analyses and visualisation methods, including co-expression networks and clustered heatmaps. While the main aim of this study is to present proportionality as a means to analyse relative data, it also raises intriguing questions about the molecular mechanisms underlying the proportional regulation of a range of yeast genes.},

abstract = {The relative abundance of different species characterizes the structure of a biological community. We analyze an experiment addressing the relationship between omnivorous feeding linkages and community stability. Our goal is to determine whether communities with different predator compositions respond similarly to environmental disturbance. To evaluate these data, we develop a hierarchical statistical model that combines Aitchison's logistic normal distribution with a conditional multinomial observation distribution. In addition, we present an algebra for compositions that includes addition, scalar multiplication, and a metric for differences in compositions. The algebra aids interpretation of treatment effects, treatment interactions, and covariates. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for inference in a Bayesian framework. Our experimental results indicate that a high degree of omnivory can help to stabilize community dynamics and prevent radical shifts in community composition. This result is at odds with classical food-web predictions, but agrees with recent theoretical formulations.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The high-dimensionality of many compositional data sets has caused geologists to look for insights into the observed patterns of variability through two dimension-reducing procedures: (i) the selection of a few subcompositions for particular study, and (ii) principal component analysis. After a brief critical review of the unsatisfactory state of current statistical methodology for these two procedures, this paper takes as a starting point for the resolution of persisting difficulties a recent approach to principal component analysis through a new definition of the covariance structure of a composition. This approach is first applied for expository purposes to a small illustrative compositional data set and then to a number of larger published geochemical data sets. The new approach then leads naturally to a method measuring the extent to which a subcomposition retains the pattern of variability of the whole composition and so provides a criterion for the selection of suitable subcompositions. Such a selection process is illustrated by application to geochemical data sets.},

'Standard' multivariate techniques, designed for unconstrained data, are wholly inappropriate and uninterpretable for such data and yet are still being commonly misapplied. Recognition that the study of compositions must satisfy simple principles has led recently to the advocacy of new forms of analysis of compositional data.
