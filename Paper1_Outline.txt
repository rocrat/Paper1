Paper 1 Outline (LOOK FOR APPROPRIATE BIOINFORMATICS JOURNAL - MAYBE SOMETHING NGS FOCUSED)

Title:  Relative frequency measurements: Metrics for sample quality, sequencing integrity, and batch effects in targeted NGS.

I) Introduction - Introduce the problem and motivate the research
  P1) There is a need for robust quality control and batch effect removal for NGS bases RNA sequencing to reach its full clinical utility
  P2) Brief discussion of RNA sequencing data as a composition
  P3) Introduction to compositional data constraints and potential pitfalls
  P4) Outline of the paper
    i) Present introduction to compositional methods
    ii) Compositional QC metrics
      a) Sample Quality Metrics
        1) Proportion of total reads in a run allocated to each sample
        2) Proportion of total reads in a sample allocated to exogenous controls
      b) Sequencing Integrity Metrics
        1) Proportionality of exogenous positive controls
        
    iii) Compositional analyses
      a) CLR as a "normalization" transformation
      b) Aitchison Distance as a substitute for Euclidean distance
      c) Amalgamations as an exploratory analysis tool
    
II) Introduction to Compositional Methods (PARE THIS DOWN TO JUST THE ESSENTIALS)
  P1) Definition of a composition with motivating example
  P2) Total sum constraint
  P3) Implications for covariance matrices
  P4) Log-ratio transformations and the CLR
  P5) Implications for measuring distance
  P6) Aitchison distance

III) Compositional QC Metrics
  P1) Using proportions for quality control
  P2) Proportion of total reads in a run allocated to each sample (Sample Quality Metric)
  P3) Proportion of total reads in a sample allocated to exogenous controls (Sample Quality Metric)(Not sure if this works)
  P4) Proportionality of exogenous positive controls (Sequencing Integrity Metric)
  
IV) Analysis of Compositions
  P1) CLR as a "normalization" 
    i) Compare to other methods which use a scaling factor
    ii) Not necessary to have assumption of non-DE genes
  P2) Aitchison Distance as a substitute for Euclidean distance
  P3) The power of amalgamations
  
V) Conclusions
